# Course description and objectives

In this course we examine the material forms of literature in Europe and European colonies from antiquity to about 1800.
Topics include writing systems and the languages of literature, the production and distribution of books, the transmission of texts, copyright, censorship, literacy, and the cultural contexts of reading.
Our focus is on the centuries immediately before and after the development in Europe of technologies for printing by movable type.
What was the printed book like in the early days, when that technology was still new, and how were works of literature published, circulated, and read before print?
The terminus in 1800 corresponds to the emergence of new technologies of printing (notably, the steam-powered press) and new political and cultural contexts of literary production (modern states and their national languages).
Students will conduct research on manuscripts and early printed books in the collections of the Newberry Library and Cudahy Memorial Library, as the basis for class presentations and midterm and final essays.

Objectives:

-   Gain an understanding of technologies and practices of written communication in pre-industrial Europe
-   Develop skills for interpreting and engaging critically with the material forms of early printed books and manuscripts
-   Conduct independent research in a special collections library
-   Refine and develop skills of formal expository writing and researched argument

# Assignments and assessment
## Participation
Students will complete the course readings and assignments and participate in discussion.

## Research
Students will conduct independent research on manuscripts and early printed books in the collections of the [Newberry Library](https://www.newberry.org/) and Loyola University [Archives and Special Collections](https://www.luc.edu/archives/index.shtml).

Students based near the Lakeshore Campus can reach the Newberry Library easily by taking the free Loyola shuttle bus to the Water Tower campus and walking to the library at 60 W. Walton St.
Alternatively, take the Red Line to Clark and Division.
Review the Newberry's [[covid]{.smallcaps}-19 visitor policy](https://www.newberry.org/visit) in advance of your visit.

Research on primary sources should be supported by secondary scholarship.
Recent handbooks and collaborative histories supply valuable direction.
Bibliographical details are collected on [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/irc7/collections/IX7IF9FS).
See too the Oxford Bibliographies for
[Medieval Manuscripts](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780199846719/obo-9780199846719-0165.xml)
and [Printing and the Book](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0004.xml).
The vital guide to medieval manuscripts at the Newberry Library is:

- @SaengerCataloguePre1500Western1989

See too @ClemensIntroductionManuscriptStudies2007.

## Assignments
There are three principal assignments, each of which has an oral and written component.
Presentations should be about 15 minutes in length, accompanied by slides.
Usually a presentation will be followed by class discussion;
the best presentations invite thoughtful response from your peers.

Grades are assigned to the written components.
Dates are listed on the course schedule.

### A report on a printed book
Students will select and study a pre-1800 printed book in the collection of the Newberry Library or the Loyola University Archives and Special Collections.
Use the questions in
[@WernerStudyingEarlyPrinted2019, pp. 106--117],
to guide your attention.
Make a presentation to the class, then write up your research as an essay of 10--12 pages.

### A topical report
Students will select one of the topics listed on the syllabus and conduct research on it.
Make a presentation to the class, then write up your research as a report.
The written report should be 8--10 pages in length and is due at the beginning of class one week after the class presentation.

### Final project
Students will prepare a final project on a topic of their choice, following discussion with the professor.
Projects should be based on study of primary source materials in the Newberry Library and/or Loyola University Archives and Special Collections and supported by relevant secondary scholarship.
Make a presentation to the class, then write up your research as an essay of 15--20 pages.

# Policies
## Attendance
Arrange your schedule to be present for the entire session.
If you must miss a class, or if you must arrive late or leave early, inform me in advance by email.
See [Participation].

## Late work
If illness or another event in your life prevents you from completing a written assignment on time, alert me promptly by email.
Do not wait for me to contact you.
I will usually accommodate late work, provided that you have a legitimate reason for requesting an extension.
Unexcused late work may be marked down.

## Academic integrity
Loyola University Chicago takes seriously the issues of plagiarism and academic integrity.
Plagiarism will result in a grade of zero for the plagiarized exam or assignment and the incident will be reported to your dean.
If you are uncertain what constitutes plagiarism, consult the Writing Center's guide on [Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism](http://wpacouncil.org/aws/CWPA/pt/sd/news_article/272555/_PARENT/layout_details/false).
If you are still uncertain, please ask me.
Below is an excerpt from the English Department's statement:

> The English Department wishes to make it clear here that no distinctions should be made between the following acts and that all should be regarded as serious and wrong:

> - Copying from a published or on-line source, or a source in any medium, without proper documentation
> - Purchasing a pre-written paper
> - Letting someone else write a paper for you or paying someone to do so
> - Submitting as your own someone else\'s unpublished work, either with or without permission

## Privacy
Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in on-line and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. Recordings of instructional activities occurring in on-line or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings.

The instructor of this class will not record class sessions held face-to-face.
Class sessions held on-line may be recorded by the instructor for the benefit of students in the course, as insurance against faulty internet connections.
Students may record class sessions only with formal written approval from the Student Accessibility Center.
See the section [Accommodations and assistance].

## Public health
If you contract a potentially contagious illness you should not attend class meetings during the period in which you are contagious.
Notify me at the earliest convenient opportunity; I will help you get caught up.
You will not be penalized for absences due to illness or [covid-19]{.smallcaps} quarantine.

In response to changes in [covid-19]{.smallcaps} infection rates and following guidance of national, state, and city authorities, the University may revise the health policies currently in place.
We will comply with University policies.

## Communication
Students are invited to visit [office hours](#registrar-details).
No appointment is required.
If a schedule conflict prevents you from visiting regular office hours, email me to request an alternative time.

Outside of office hours email is the best way to reach me.
I aim to respond to email messages within 24 hours on weekdays and within 48 hours on weekends.
I ask that you also respond promptly to any messages I may send.


## Diversity, inclusion, and equity
Loyola University provides equal opportunities in education without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of, age, color, disability, family responsibilities, familial status, gender identity or gender expression, marital status, national origin, personal appearance, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, source of income, veteran’s status or any other factor prohibited by law.
Each member of our course has a responsibility to create an environment in which all may flourish.

An additional note on names and gender pronouns:
using appropriate names and gender pronouns honors and affirms individuals of all gender identities and gender expressions.
Misgendering and heteronormative language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identities may not fit the gender binary, or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.
During our first class, as we introduce ourselves, you may choose to share your name and gender pronouns.
If you do not wish to be called by the name listed on the roster, please inform the class.
If you prefer to introduce yourself by name only, without pronouns, that is also fine.
The goal is to create an affirming environment for all students.

## Accommodations and assistance
Loyola University Chicago provides reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with the Student Accessibility Center (SAC). Students are encouraged to meet with their professor individually to discuss their accommodations. All information will remain confidential.

Please note that in this class, software may be used to audio record class lectures in order to provide equal access to students with disabilities. Students approved for this accommodation use recordings for their personal study only and recordings may not be shared with other people or used in any way against the faculty member, other lecturers, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class activity. Recordings are deleted at the end of the semester.
For more information about registering with SAC or questions about accommodations, please contact SAC at 773-508-3700 or <SAC@luc.edu> or visit the [SAC website](http://www.luc.edu/sac/).

Additional assistance is available from the following campus offices:
