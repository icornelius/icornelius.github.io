# Course description and objectives

One consequence of the current digital revolution is an upswell of curiosity about earlier technologies of communication, entertainment, and learning. What was the printed book like in the early days, when that technology was still new, and how were works of literature published, circulated, and read before print? In this seminar we study poems written on either side of the European print revolution -- works by Geoffrey Chaucer, William Shakespeare, and their contemporaries -- and we inquire how these poems circulated in their own time and afterwards and why medium matters. Students will learn to read one of the styles of handwriting used by medieval scribes and they will learn to read "Middle English," the form of the English language used by Chaucer. Themes include the production of manuscript books, the origins and development of print technology, diversity and standardization in the English language, and the emergence of a self-aware tradition of poetry in English.

In this course students will:

-   Explore the imaginative possibilities of literary fiction
-   Gain an experience of literature written in historical periods and material contexts different from our own
-   Study the historical development and innovative uses of literary forms
-   Develop skills for understanding and engaging critically with forms of the English language different from the modern standard
-   Learn about the writing systems and material forms in which literature circulated prior to the development of industrial printing technologies
-   Learn about the transmission of literary texts in manuscript and print
-   Become informed and critical users of modern printed editions and on-line texts
-   Refine and develop skills of formal expository writing and literary argument
-   Conduct research on a topic in literary studies

# Assignments
Assignment due dates are listed on the [Schedule].
For weighting and general criteria of grading, see [Assessment].

## Sakai forums
Forum assignments are listed on the [Schedule];
they are few in number, though important to course objectives.
Instructions will be supplied one week in advance of the due date.

## Formal writing
Students in this writing-intensive seminar will produce formal writing on a weekly basis and discuss their work with peers at selected points during the semester.

Writing should be submitted in two forms, paper and electronic.
Paper copies are due at the beginning of class.
An identical electronic copy should be uploaded to Sakai (the Assignments tab) in Microsoft Word or PDF format.
Observe the following details in regard to the *mise en page* of your text:

- double-spaced text
- a standard 12-point font
- 1-inch margins
- numbered pages

Sources should be cited in [Chicago](https://www-chicagomanualofstyle-org.flagship.luc.edu/tools_citationguide/citation-guide-1.html)
or [MLA](https://owl.purdue.edu/owl/research_and_citation/mla_style/mla_style_introduction.html)
format.
Students are encouraged to use reference management software.
My preferred application is [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/).
It is free and open-source.

Students are invited to talk with me in office hours about any stage of the writing process and encouraged to discuss their writing with peer tutors at the [writing center](http://www.luc.edu/writing).

### Short assignments
#### Translation and critical commentary
This assignment focuses attention on details of Chaucer's language and literary art.
Each student will translate a short passage of Chaucer's poetry into good modern English prose and write a critical commentary on the Middle English.
The objective in translation is to express Chaucer's meaning as precisely as possible within the vocabulary and idiom of modern English.
Assignment instructions explain what is meant by "critical commentary."

#### Response papers
Response papers provide opportunities to explore and experiment with a variety of critical genres and approaches to literary study.
There are eight such assignments, of which you must complete six.
If you complete more than six, I will drop the lowest score(s).
Each response should be between 1.5 and 2 pages in length.
Prompts will be circulated one week in advance.
<!--
topics:
- translation and commentary
- translation to a language other than English
- response to scholarship and criticism
- annotation
- comparison of texts
-->

Once during the semester, each student will circulate their response paper to the entire class as the basis for a [peer interview].
Students will sign up for this activity in the first week of class.
In the week that you circulate your response paper to class, this paper is due 24 hours in advance of our class meeting.
All other responses are due at the beginning of class, as stated [above](#formal-writing).

#### Annotated bibliography
The annotated bibliography is a step towards the long essay (see the next section).
Consult with me and with [library specialists](http://libraries.luc.edu/specialists) in selection of sources.
The Oxford Bibliographies are a good place to begin research:

- [Geoffrey Chaucer](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195396584/obo-9780195396584-0016.xml)
- [Sir Gawain and the Green Knight](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780199846719/obo-9780199846719-0054.xml)
- [Edmund Spenser](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780199846719/obo-9780199846719-0055.xml)
- [William Shakespeare](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0052.xml)
- [Medieval Manuscripts](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780199846719/obo-9780199846719-0165.xml)
- [Printing and the Book](https://www-oxfordbibliographies-com.flagship.luc.edu/view/document/obo-9780195399301/obo-9780195399301-0004.xml)

Select six sources for annotation and list another six sources that you considered but decided against.
Additional instructions will be supplied in due course.

### Essays
There are two essays.
The short essay (5--6pp.) is an exercise in formal expository writing and interpretative argument.
Prompts and instructions will be circulated two weeks in advance of the due date.

The long essay (10--12pp.) includes a research component.
Prompts and instructions will be circulated before the Thanksgiving break.
The [annotated bibliography] and the [research presentation] are steps towards production of this essay.

## Oral presentations
### Poetry recitations
Each student will memorize two short passages of poetry.
The objective in this exercise is to heighten your attention to the words, sounds, and organization of the poetry we read, and to provoke questions about the materiality of works of art in language.

For the first poetry recitation, you will memorize either the first eighteen lines of the General Prologue to the *Canterbury Tales* or the first twenty lines of the Wife of Bath's Prologue.
For the second poetry recitation, you will memorize a passage of your choice from one of the texts of *Hamlet*.
Your passage should be about ten lines in length.
This can be done as a group activity if you select a passage in which two or three characters have substantial speaking parts.

### Peer interview
Once during the semester, you will interview one of your peers about the content of their most recent response paper.
The interviews will be conducted during our class session and should be between five and ten minutes in length.
As interviewer, you are responsible for being interested in your interviewee, drawing them out about their writing, exploring lateral connections, and prompting them to elaborate the ideas that they have presented.
There will be opportunity for audience participation at the end of each interview.

### Research presentation
After the Thanksgiving break you will make a presentation to the class on a topic related to your long essay.
Your presentation should be about ten minutes in length and supported by slides.
Usually a presentation will be followed by class discussion;
the best presentations invite thoughtful response from your peers.

## Exams
There are no exams in this course.

Writing remains clear on the whole, but makes ineffective use of textual evidence, or contains organizational or grammatical errors that impair the intelligibility or persuasiveness of the argument.
- **D ** Minimum credit. Lacks understanding of course material or initiative in literary interpretation. Writing has persistent lapses in coherence, evidentiary support, organization and/or grammar.
- **F** Does not adequately address assignment or course objectives.

# Policies
## Attendance
To meet course objectives, you must attend class and be prepared to engage in discussion.
Arrange your schedule to be present for the entire session.
If you must miss a class for any reason, or if you must arrive late or leave early, inform me in advance by email.
Unexcused absences will be penalized at a rate of ten participation points per absence.

This course makes special provision for absences due to illness or [covid-19]{.smallcaps} quarantine: see the section on [Public health].

## Alternative editions
No two editions are exactly the same.
The [textbooks](#texts) adopted for this course and on sale at the Campus Bookstore are selected on criteria of cost, quality, and availability.
These editions form the basis for class discussions;
their glosses and commentary are necessary adjuncts to the primary text.

Students must acquire physical copies of textbooks.
In recognition that some students may already own editions of the literature read in this course, I have compiled a [bibliography of acceptable alternatives](https://www.zotero.org/groups/4407416/luc_engl390-17w-2021/collections/PHVHI25P) to the editions officially adopted.
Consult me before using an edition not on this list.
In several cases the acceptable alternatives are more expensive than the editions at the Campus Bookstore.
Your text of *Hamlet* must be of the second quarto, not a modern conflation of the second quarto and the first folio.

## Revisions
The short essay may be revised for a higher grade. The revision will be due one week after return of marked essays.
Response papers and other short writing assignments are not eligible for revision, but you can replace a low grade on a response paper by writing more than the minimum number.
See the sections [Response papers] and [Weighting of course components].

## Late work
If illness or another event in your life prevents you from completing a written assignment on time, alert me promptly by email.
Do not wait for me to contact you.
I will usually accommodate late work, provided that you have a legitimate reason for requesting an extension.
Unexcused late work will be marked down and cannot be revised for a higher grade.

In the week that you circulate your [response paper](#response-papers) to class, this paper is due 24 hours in advance of our class meeting.
This is the most important deadline in our course, for our class session depends on the content you supply.
Missing this deadline will result in a penalty of up to 40 participation points.

The other deadline that commands rigorous respect is the one for the final essay.
The University requires me to report grades within 72 hours of our scheduled final exam.
If your final essay is late, I might not be able to give you credit for it.

## Academic integrity
Loyola University Chicago takes seriously the issues of plagiarism and academic integrity.
This course abides by the relevant policies of the University's [Undergraduate Studies Catalog](http://www.luc.edu/academics/catalog/undergrad/reg_academicintegrity.shtml)

Plagiarism will result in a grade of zero for the plagiarized exam or assignment and the incident will be reported to your dean.
If you are uncertain what constitutes plagiarism, consult the Writing Center's guide on [Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism](http://wpacouncil.org/aws/CWPA/pt/sd/news_article/272555/_PARENT/layout_details/false).
If you are still uncertain, please ask me.
Below is an excerpt from the English Department's statement:

> The English Department wishes to make it clear here that no distinctions should be made between the following acts and that all should be regarded as serious and wrong:

> - Copying from a published or on-line source, or a source in any medium, without proper documentation
> - Purchasing a pre-written paper
> - Letting someone else write a paper for you or paying someone to do so
> - Submitting as your own someone else\'s unpublished work, either with or without permission

## Privacy
<!--
Assuring privacy among faculty and students engaged in on-line and face-to-face instructional activities helps promote open and robust conversations and mitigates concerns that comments made within the context of the class will be shared beyond the classroom. Recordings of instructional activities occurring in on-line or face-to-face classes may be used solely for internal class purposes by the faculty member and students registered for the course, and only during the period in which the course is offered. Students will be informed of such recordings by a statement in the syllabus for the course in which they will be recorded. Instructors who wish to make subsequent use of recordings that include student activity may do so only with informed written consent of the students involved or if all student activity is removed from the recording. Recordings including student activity that have been initiated by the instructor may be retained by the instructor only for individual use. 
-->
The instructor of this class will not record class sessions.
Any change to this policy will be announced and properly documented in class, on Sakai, and by revision of this syllabus.
Students may record class sessions only with formal written approval from the Student Accessibility Center.
See the section [Accommodations and assistance].

## Public health
If you contract a potentially contagious illness you should not attend class meetings during the period in which you are contagious.
Notify me at the earliest convenient opportunity; I will help you get caught up.
Absences due to illness or [covid-19]{.smallcaps} quarantine are not charged against your participation score.

In response to changes in [covid-19]{.smallcaps} infection rates and following guidance of national, state, and city authorities, the University may relax the universal masking requirement currently in place.
We will comply with University regulations in this and all other matters of public health.

## Communication
Students are invited to come speak with me during regular [office hours](#instructor-detail).
No appointment is required.
If a schedule conflict prevents you from visiting regular office hours, email me to request an alternative time.

Outside of office hours email is the best way to reach me.
I aim to respond to email messages within 24 hours on weekdays and within 48 hours on weekends.
I ask that you also respond promptly to any messages I may send.


## Diversity, inclusion, and equity
Loyola University provides equal opportunities in education without regard to, and does not discriminate on the basis of age, color, disability, family responsibilities, familial status, gender identity or gender expression, marital status, national origin, personal appearance, political affiliation, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, source of income, veteran’s status or any other factor prohibited by law.
Learning to respect others is an important part of education; students in this course will refrain from profanity and insult, but we also have positive responsibilities in this regard.
Each member of our course has a responsibility to create an environment in which all may flourish.

An additional note on names and gender pronouns:
using appropriate names and gender pronouns honors and affirms individuals of all gender identities and gender expressions.
Misgendering and heteronormative language excludes the experiences of individuals whose identities may not fit the gender binary, and/or who may not identify with the sex they were assigned at birth.
Therefore, during our first class, as we introduce ourselves, you may choose to share your name and gender pronouns.
If you do not wish to be called by the name listed on the roster, please inform the class.
If you prefer to introduce yourself by name only, without pronouns, that is also fine.
The goal is to create an affirming environment for all students.

## Accommodations and assistance
Loyola University Chicago provides reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities. Any student requesting accommodations related to a disability or other condition is required to register with the Student Accessibility Center (SAC). Professors will receive an accommodation notification from SAC, preferably within the first two weeks of class. Students are encouraged to meet with their professor individually to discuss their accommodations. All information will remain confidential.

Please note that in this class, software may be used to audio record class lectures in order to provide equal access to students with disabilities. Students approved for this accommodation use recordings for their personal study only and recordings may not be shared with other people or used in any way against the faculty member, other lecturers, or students whose classroom comments are recorded as part of the class activity. Recordings are deleted at the end of the semester.
For more information about registering with SAC or questions about accommodations, please contact SAC at 773-508-3700 or <SAC@luc.edu> or visit the [SAC website](http://www.luc.edu/sac/).
