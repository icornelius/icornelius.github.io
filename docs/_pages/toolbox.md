In the past several years I have adopted open-source terminal-based applications for most of the work I do on a computer.
[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) is the application I use for writing and for any task that involves creating and editing text.
It is where I spend most of my time.
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) supplies the grammar.
[`git`](https://git-scm.com/) provides incremental persistent file history, useful in late stages of editing and for reacquainting myself with any document that hasn't continuously been at the center of my attention.
The [Voom](https://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2657) plugin for Vim provides an outline-view of complex document structures and makes it easy to reorder an argument.
Vim's [digraphs](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/digraph.html) put many non-English and non-modern characters within easy reach.
[Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is the bibliographic software I have used since 2007, and the only GUI on this list.
[Better BibTeX](https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/) writes the ligatures between Zotero's bibliographic records and the documents I write, enabling citation.
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org), with an assist from LaTeX and [Citation Style Language](https://citationstyles.org/), turns markdown-formatted text into elegant pdfs.
Pandoc also writes the Microsoft Word `docx` files that most publishers in the humanities still expect.

That's the general writing stack, but the writing would be a lot harder without well-organized accessible research notes.
Enter [ZettelGeist](https://github.com/ZettelGeist), a brilliant program written by my friend [George Thiruvathukal](https://gkt.cs.luc.edu/), to whom I owe much of the above.

The most recent additions to the toolbox are [sup](https://sup-heliotrope.github.io/) and [calcurse](https://calcurse.org/), email and calendar applications that are in fact a pleasure to use.
