I teach in the Department of English at Loyola University Chicago, where my work centers on poetics, literary language, book history, and the histories of texts, mostly in English.

In the undergraduate program I teach an introduction to literary reading, a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey, and upper-division courses in medieval English and European literature.
A recent favorite is "[English Poetry from Manuscript to Print]."
My graduate teaching has included seminars on pre-industrial European book history, Old English language and literature, *Piers Plowman*, and the reception of Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*.
I also convene an informal weekly reading group in medieval philology, focusing on Old English and Latin.

Current projects include the following:

1. An [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials](https://peripheralmss.org/) held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest. This is a collaboration with Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau and funded by a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR).
1. A digital documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23.
This is a collaboration with J. Eric Ensley and intended for the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).
1. An [exploratory collaboration](https://voices.uchicago.edu/cedar/projects/) between the *Piers Plowman Electronic Archive* and *Critical Editions for Digital Analysis and Research* (CEDAR), funded by the Neubauer Collegium at the University of Chicago.
1. [ZettelGeist](https://zettelgeist.github.io/), an open-source terminal-based notetaking system. This is a collaboration led by George K. Thiruvathukal. I describe a use-case [here](https://icornelius.github.io/posts/2022/09/using-zettelgeist/).
1. Articles and essays in medieval English philology.
Recent publications include "Langland parrhesiastes," published in [a collection of essays] honoring David Lawton, one of my first teachers of medieval literature,
and "Language and Meter," in [*What Kind of a Thing is a Middle English Lyric?*](https://www.pennpress.org/9780812253900/what-kind-of-a-thing-is-a-middle-english-lyric/).

Details on published works are listed in my [cv] and [zotero profile], both of which supply links where available.
