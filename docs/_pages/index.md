I study poetics, literary language, book history, and the histories of texts as a member of the English faculty at Loyola University Chicago.
At Loyola I teach for the core curriculum (an interdisciplinary survey of cultures of the ancient and medieval Mediterranean, and introductions to literary reading and poetry), undergraduate English major (Old English, the history of the English language, and medieval and early modern English literature), and English graduate programs (medieval English literature, pre-industrial European book history).
Materials for [some recent courses](https://github.com/icornelius/zg-syllabi) are posted on-line.
From July 2024 I will serve as Director of Graduate Programs in English.

Details on published works are listed in my [cv] and [zotero profile], both of which supply links where available.
Many of my publications can be downloaded from [eCommons].

Current projects include the following:

1. Studies in English and medieval Latin philology.
   Some recent studies appear in the collections *Literary Theory and Criticism in the Later Middle Ages* (2023), *The Sound of Writing* (2023), *Medieval Literary Voices* (2022), and *What Kind of a Thing is a Middle English Lyric?* (2022).
1. Data curation for the *Digital Index of Middle English Verse*.
   Early prototypes for a new data structure are on [GitHub](https://github.com/icornelius/dimev-sandbox).
1. An [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials](https://peripheralmss.org/) held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest.
   This project is led by Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau and funded by a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR).
   Related articles have appeared in *Manuscript Studies* (2023) and *The Journal of the Early Book Society* (2023).
1. A documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23.
   A related article has appeared in *The Journal of the Early Book Society* (2023).
1. [ZettelGeist](https://zettelgeist.github.io/), an open-source terminal-based notetaking system created by George K. Thiruvathukal.
   I describe a use-case [here](https://icornelius.github.io/posts/2022/09/using-zettelgeist/).
