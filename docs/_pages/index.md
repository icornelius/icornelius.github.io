I teach in the Department of English at Loyola University Chicago, where I study poetics, literary language, book history, and the histories of texts, mostly in English.

In the undergraduate program I teach an introduction to literary reading, a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey, and upper-division courses in book history, the history of the English language, and medieval English and European literatures.
My graduate teaching has included seminars on pre-industrial European book history, Old English language and literature, *Piers Plowman*, and the reception of Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*.
Materials for several recent courses are [published on-line](https://github.com/icornelius/zg-syllabi).
I also convene an informal weekly reading group in medieval English philology.

Current projects include the following:

1. Articles and essays on early English literature, especially poetry.
1. An [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials](https://peripheralmss.org/) held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest. This is a collaboration with Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau and funded by a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR).
A related article is forthcoming in volume 8, issue 2 of [*Manuscript Studies*].
1. A digital documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23.
This is a collaboration with J. Eric Ensley and intended for the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).
A related article is forthcoming in volume 26 of the [*Journal of the Early Book Society*].
I describe the editorial method in this [conference paper](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c17f0873-ac2b-4e8f-926a-aebb012b1641).
1. [ZettelGeist](https://zettelgeist.github.io/), an open-source terminal-based notetaking system. This is a collaboration led by George K. Thiruvathukal. I describe a use-case [here](https://icornelius.github.io/posts/2022/09/using-zettelgeist/).
1. An [exploratory collaboration](https://voices.uchicago.edu/cedar/projects/) between the *Piers Plowman Electronic Archive* and *Critical Editions for Digital Analysis and Research* (CEDAR), funded by the Neubauer Collegium at the University of Chicago.
