I teach in the Department of English at Loyola University Chicago, where I study poetics, literary language, book history, and the histories of texts.

My recent teaching includes a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey (antiquity and Middle Ages), introductions to literary reading and poetry, and courses on Old English, the history of the English language, and medieval and early modern English and European literature;
also graduate courses on pre-industrial European book history, *Piers Plowman*, and Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*.
Materials for [some recent courses](https://github.com/icornelius/zg-syllabi) are published on-line.
I also convene a weekly reading group in medieval English philology.

Details on published works are listed in my [cv] and [zotero profile], both of which supply links where available.
Many of my publications can be downloaded from [eCommons].

Current projects include the following:

1. Articles on early English literature, especially poetry.
1. An [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials](https://peripheralmss.org/) held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest. This is a collaboration with Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau and funded by a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR).
A related article is forthcoming in volume 8, issue 2 of [*Manuscript Studies*].
1. A digital documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23.
This is a collaboration with J. Eric Ensley and intended for the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).
A related article is forthcoming in volume 26 of the [*Journal of the Early Book Society*].
I describe the editorial method in this [conference paper](https://luc.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=c17f0873-ac2b-4e8f-926a-aebb012b1641).
1. [ZettelGeist](https://zettelgeist.github.io/), an open-source terminal-based notetaking system. This is a collaboration led by George K. Thiruvathukal. I describe a use-case [here](https://icornelius.github.io/posts/2022/09/using-zettelgeist/).
