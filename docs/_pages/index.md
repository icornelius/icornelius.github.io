I teach in the Department of English at Loyola University Chicago, where my work centers on poetics, literary language, book history, and the histories of texts, mostly in English.

In the undergraduate program I teach an introduction to literary reading, a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey, and upper-division courses in medieval English and European literature.
A recent favorite is "[English Poetry from Manuscript to Print]."
My graduate teaching has included seminars on pre-industrial European book history, Old English language and literature, *Piers Plowman*, and the reception of Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*.
I also convene an informal weekly reading group in medieval philology, focusing on Old English and Latin.

I am currently engaged in two multiyear projects:

1. A digital documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23.
This is a collaboration with J. Eric Ensley and intended for the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).
2. An [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials](https://peripheralmss.org/) held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest. This is a collaboration with Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau and funded by a grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources (CLIR).

A spotlighted recent publication is "Langland Parrhesiastes," published in [a collection of essays] honoring David Lawton, one of my first teachers of medieval literature.
Here is a précis:

> The ancient Greek word *parrhēsia* designates speech that is bold, frank, and free, holding nothing back; a *parrhēsiastēs* is a person who gives voice to such speech.
  Although the word was little used in Latin literature and had no precise Latin equivalent, the concept was transmitted to medieval western Europe in rhetorical theory and the New Testament.
  In this essay I propose that the concept of *parrhēsia* may help to register the irruptive force, pointedness, risks, and complexity of certain acts of saying in *Piers Plowman*, a fourteenth-century English vision poem.
  For most of this essay, I focus on a single discursive feature of *Piers Plowman*:
  moral admonishment addressed in the second person to audiences outside the represented world of the poem.
  I argue that monitory address is an important and well-defined feature of *Piers Plowman*,
  that the poet's confidence in his monitory voice grows during his composition of the poem,
  and that this feature of the poem culminates in Conscience's parrhesiastic addresses to bishops and the King in the C Version Prologue.
  As a coda to this argument, I propose a reading of the dreamer as a figure of wisdom-seeking *parrhēsia*.
