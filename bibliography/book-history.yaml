  abstract: >-
    The Middle English ABC of Aristotle is an alliterative abecedary poem that
    survives in fifteen manuscript copies dating between the mid-fifteenth and
    early sixteenth centuries. The most eccentric copy, bearing the greatest
    number of unique textual variants, is in London, British Library, Additional
    60577, a commonplace book and miscellany of verse and prose known today as
    the ‘Winchester Anthology’. The Winchester copy of the ABC of Aristotle is
    distinguished from all others by changes to vocabulary, idiom, and prosody.
    The result is a unique redaction, illustrating the kind of literary
    composition that could be expected to grow out of late medieval English
    grammar schools. The Winchester redaction also expresses a shift in prosodic
    allegiance. The traditional alliterative line is subtly reshaped into an
    accentual-syllabic form.

  abstract: >-
    Revolution and the Word is the classic study of the co-emergence of the U.S.
    nation and the new literary genre of the novel. The book remains the
    foundational study of reading, writing, and publishing in the new republic
    and provides a unique glimpse of the culture of early America. By looking at
    everything from publishers' account books to marginalia scrawled in
    eighteenth-century books to the novels themselves, Revolution and the Word
    provides an engaging social history of early American readership that is
    also informed by the most insightful aspects of literary theory. With a
    backward glance at the culture wars and prognostications for what lies
    ahead, the comprehensive introduction of this expanded edition reframes
    Revolution and the Word for a new generation of scholars. It revisits topics
    of dissent in the early national period, the status of the Constitution as a
    document designed to quell the still-burning passions of the American
    Revolution, and the role played by the novel in publicizing and articulating
    complex desires not addressed at the Constitutional Convention. Cathy N.
    Davidson provides readers with a survey and critique of the controversial
    and productive thought in cultural, social, and political theory as it has
    evolved during the last twenty years. This astute and learned assessment of
    recent developments in literary and historical scholarship, colonial and
    postcolonial studies, race theory, gender and sexuality theory, class
    studies, cultural studies, and history of the book will make Revolution and
    the Word as urgent for this generation as it was for its original readers in
    1986.

  abstract: >-
    Modern studies of books as material objects have neglected the fact that in
    sixteenth- and seventeenth-century England blackletter type was called
    “English.” Consequently, they have neglected the implications of such a
    designation. Returning blackletter type to its original context as “English”
    type demonstrates how it signified the English language. The relation
    between type and language expanded beyond black letter and the English
    language. Reflecting Continental typographic trends, English printers set
    modern European languages other than English in the typefaces in which they
    normally appeared in their native countries. In this way, typefaces
    represented a visual expression of language and nationality. The use of
    black-letter type in the first edition of Edmund Spenser’s Shepheardes
    Calender was a deliberate typographical deviation from its bibliographic
    model, a 1571 edition of Jacopo Sannazaro’s Arcadia. This deviation
    superimposed the English vernacular, represented by black-letter or
    “English” type, onto the Italian vernacular, represented by italic and roman
    type. The choice of “English” type supported the book’s overarching
    promotion of English literature and language, along with Spenser’s
    self-promotion as an English poet.

    This essay recounts lessons learned over a career studying medieval
    manuscripts and the stories of those who made, used, and collected them.
    Medieval books long outlast their intended or original audiences and have
    fascinating cultural interactions that extend to the present. What this most
    pressingly throws up for me is ways of knowing things, and the
    epistemological value of memory. One needs to store away the little
    anomalies that one encounters — and be prepared for them to surface without
    bidding in some new context where they might prove generative. If humility
    might be a first perquisite of scholarly work, certainly memory would be a
    second. The essay originated as a lecture, delivered remotely in March 2021
    for the Renaissance Studies Center at the Newberry Library in Chicago, IL.

  abstract: >-
    Throughout human history, the world's knowledge and fruits of the creative
    imagination have been produced, circulated and received through the medium
    of the material text. This Companion provides a wide-ranging account of the
    history of the book and its ways of thinking about works from ancient
    inscription to contemporary e-books, discussing thematic, chronological and
    methodological aspects of this interdisciplinary field. The first part
    considers book cultures from local, national and global perspectives. Part
    two, organized around the dynamic relationship between the material book and
    the mutable text, develops a loosely chronological narrative from early
    writing, through manuscript and early printing, to the institution of a
    mechanized book trade, and on to the globalization of publishing and the
    introduction of the electronic book. A third part takes a practical turn,
    discussing methods, sources and approaches: bibliographical, archival and
    reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical strategies.

    In Bibliography and the Sociology of Texts, D. F. McKenzie shows how the
    material form of texts crucially determines their meanings. He unifies the
    principal interests of both critical theory and textual scholarship to
    demonstrate that, as all works of lasting value are reproduced, re-edited
    and re-read, they take on different forms and meanings. By witnessing the
    new needs of their new readers these new forms constitute vital evidence for
    any history of reading. McKenzie shows this is true of all forms of recorded
    information, including sound, graphics,  films, representations of landscape
    and the new electronic media. The bibliographical skills first developed for
    manuscripts and books can, he shows, be applied to a wide range of cultural
    documents. This book, which incorporates McKenzie's classic work on orality
    and literacy in early New Zealand, offers a unifying concept of texts that
    seeks to acknowledge their variety and the complexity of their
    relationships.

    Throughout human history, the world's knowledge and fruits of the creative
    imagination have been produced, circulated and received through the medium
    of the material text. This Companion provides a wide-ranging account of the
    history of the book and its ways of thinking about works from ancient
    inscription to contemporary e-books, discussing thematic, chronological and
    methodological aspects of this interdisciplinary field. The first part
    considers book cultures from local, national and global perspectives. Part
    two, organized around the dynamic relationship between the material book and
    the mutable text, develops a loosely chronological narrative from early
    writing, through manuscript and early printing, to the institution of a
    mechanized book trade, and on to the globalization of publishing and the
    introduction of the electronic book. A third part takes a practical turn,
    discussing methods, sources and approaches: bibliographical, archival and
    reading experience methodologies, as well as pedagogical strategies.

  abstract: >-
    The period from 1695 to 1830, from the lapse of the Licensing Act to the eve
    of the Reform Bill, thus saw major transformations in the legal culture
    within which the book trade operated. When the guild system was supplanted
    by the Statute of Anne, however, the great booksellers managed to maintain
    control of their valuable old copyrights for the better part of a century
    until in 1774 the House of Lords declared copyright to be limited in term.
    Instead of basing the term of copyright protection solely on publication,
    the Act related it to the author's life by providing protection for
    twenty-eight years or the life of the author, whichever was longer. This
    marked a major conceptual evolution in copyright. The lapse of the Licensing
    Act ended pre-publication censorship and radically changed the power of the
    state to regulate the press, but it did not totally end regulation.

  abstract: "A comprehensive resource to understanding the hand-press printing of early books Studying Early Printed Books, 1450 - 1800 offers a guide to the fascinating process of how books were printed in the first centuries of the press and shows how the mechanics of making books shapes how we read and understand them. The author offers an insightful overview of how books were made in the hand-press period and then includes an in-depth review of the specific aspects of the printing process. She addresses questions such as: How was paper made? What were different book formats? How did the press work? In addition, the text is filled with illustrative examples that demonstrate how understanding the early processes can be helpful to today’s researchers. Studying Early Printed Books shows the connections between the material form of a book (what it looks like and how it was made), how a book conveys its meaning and how it is used by readers. The author helps readers navigate books by explaining how to tell which parts of a book are the result of early printing practices and which are a result of later changes. The text also offers guidance on: how to approach a book; how to read a catalog record; the difference between using digital facsimiles and books in-hand. This important guide:  Reveals how books were made with the advent of the printing press and how they are understood today Offers information on how to use digital reproductions of early printed books as well as how to work in a rare books library Contains a useful glossary and a detailed list of recommended readings Includes a companion website for further research\_  Written for students of book history, materiality of text and history of information, Studying Early Printed Books explores the many aspects of the early printing process of books and explains how their form is understood today."
