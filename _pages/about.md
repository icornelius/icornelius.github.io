I teach in the Department of English at Loyola University Chicago as [Edward Surtz, S.J.](https://www.luc.edu/english/surtz.shtml), Associate Professor. 
Much of my work concerns poetics and literary language. 
I am also interested in the long histories of thinking about these topics. 

I am currently engaged in two large projects: 
a digital documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23, 
and an [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest](https://peripheralmss.org/blog/). 
The digital edition is a collaboration with James Eric Ensley and intended for the [*Piers Plowman* Electronic Archive](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/). 
The on-line repository is a collaboration with Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau, funded by a three-year grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources. 

At Loyola I regularly teach an introduction to literary reading and a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey (antiquity and Middle Ages), plus upper-division courses in medieval English and European literature. 
My graduate teaching has included seminars on *Piers Plowman*, an introduction to Old English language and literature, and a ten-week seminar at the Newberry Library on [Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy* and its afterlife](https://icornelius.github.io/boethius2019/).

My first book, [*Reconstructing Alliterative Verse: The Pursuit of a Medieval Meter*](http://www.cambridge.org/9781107154100) (Cambridge, 2017), was about the past and future of the verse form employed in William Langland's *Piers Plowman*. 
This book argued that the irregular rhythms of alliterative poetry come into sharper focus when viewed in diachronic perspective. 
The meter was always in transition; 
to understand it, we must reconstruct the stages of its development and recognize where it was headed at the moment it died out.
Subsequent work in this area includes 
an [article](https://academic.oup.com/res/article-abstract/70/293/14/5232559) on the text and form of the *Lay Folks' Catechism*, 
and a [review article](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.YLS.5.116161) on a new edition of *Piers Plowman* B. 
A short essay on 'Versification' appeared in [*Approaches to Teaching Langland's 'Piers Plowman'*](https://www.mla.org/Publications/Bookstore/Approaches-to-Teaching-World-Literature/Approaches-to-Teaching-Langland-s-Piers-Plowman) (2018). 
Articles on related topics are at various stages of development. 

A second, smaller cluster of projects concerns Boethius's *Consolatio philosophiae* and its reception. 
I have written on this topic for the medieval volume of the [*Oxford History of Classical Reception in English Literature*](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587230.001.0001/acprof-9780199587230-chapter-14) (2016), 
and I have completed an essay on the sources of George Colvile's 1556 translation of Boethius's text. 
Studies of the text and sources of John Walton's 1410 verse translation of the *Consolatio* will follow, but not soon. 

A third research area centers on medieval literary education, or the disciplines of grammar and rhetoric. 
I surveyed the history of these disciplines for [Wiley-Blackwell's *Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118396957.wbemlb492) (2017). 
An essay on 'ecologies of Latin poetics' is in preparation for a global history of post-classical Latin literature. 

Details on published work, with some abstracts and links to texts, can be found on [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/irc7) and elsewhere.
