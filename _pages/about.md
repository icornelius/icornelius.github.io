I teach in the Department of English at Loyola University Chicago, where my work centers on poetics, literary language, and textual access.
I am also interested in the long histories of thinking about these topics.

I am currently engaged in two large projects:
a digital documentary edition of the text of *Piers Plowman* in New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23,
and an [on-line repository of medieval manuscript materials](https://peripheralmss.org/) held in smaller institutional collections in the American Midwest.
The digital edition is a collaboration with James Eric Ensley and Paul A. Broyles and intended for the [*Piers Plowman Electronic Archive*](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).
The on-line repository is a collaboration with Sarah Noonan, Elizabeth Hebbard, and Michelle Dalmau, funded by a three-year grant from the Council on Library and Information Resources.

At Loyola I regularly teach an introduction to literary reading, an introduction to poetry, a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey (antiquity and Middle Ages), and upper-division courses in medieval English and European literature.
My graduate teaching has included seminars on *Piers Plowman*, the works of Geoffrey Chaucer, Old English language and literature, and the medieval and early modern reception of Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*.

My first book, [*Reconstructing Alliterative Verse: The Pursuit of a Medieval Meter*](http://www.cambridge.org/9781107154100) (Cambridge, 2017), was about the past and future of the verse form employed in William Langland's *Piers Plowman*.
This book argued that the irregular rhythms of alliterative poetry come into sharper focus when viewed in diachronic perspective.
The meter was always in transition;
to understand it, we must reconstruct the stages of its development and recognize where it was headed at the moment it died out.
Subsequent work in this area includes articles on
[the text and form of the *Lay Folks' Catechism*](https://academic.oup.com/res/article-abstract/70/293/14/5232559),
[a scribal redaction of *The ABC of Aristotle*](https://doi.org/10.1515/ang-2021-0026),
and ["The intricacies of counting to four in Old English verse"](https://doi.org/10.1177/09639470211012297).
Articles on related topics are at various stages of preparation.

A second, smaller cluster of projects concerns Boethius's *Consolatio philosophiae* and its reception.
I have written on this topic for the medieval volume of the [*Oxford History of Classical Reception in English Literature*](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587230.001.0001/acprof-9780199587230-chapter-14) (2016),
and I have completed an essay on the sources of George Colvile's 1556 translation of Boethius's text.
Studies of the text and sources of John Walton's 1410 verse translation of the *Consolatio* will follow, but not soon.

A third research area centers on medieval literary education, or the disciplines of grammar and rhetoric.
I surveyed the history of these disciplines for [Wiley-Blackwell's *Encyclopedia of Medieval Literature in Britain*](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/9781118396957.wbemlb492) (2017).
An essay on 'ecologies of Latin poetics' is in preparation for a global history of post-classical Latin literature.

Reviews and review essays have appeared in the journals
*Anglia*,
*Arthuriana*,
*The Journal of English and Germanic Philology*,
*The Medieval Review*,
*Medium Ævum*,
and
*The Yearbook of Langland Studies*.

Details on published works are in my [current cv](https://icornelius.github.io/files/cornelius-cv.pdf).
