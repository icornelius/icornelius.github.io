I teach in the [Department of English at Loyola University Chicago](http://www.luc.edu/english/index.shtml) as [Edward Surtz, S.J.](https://www.luc.edu/english/surtz.shtml), Associate Professor. 
I study medieval English literature, especially the form and language of Middle English poetry, and aspects of literary education and Latin literary culture in the Middle Ages.

I am author of [*Reconstructing Alliterative Verse: The Pursuit of a Medieval Meter*](http://www.cambridge.org/9781107154100), published by Cambridge University Press. 
Other recent publications include an essay on 
[the reception of Boethius's *Consolatio philosophiae* in medieval England](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199587230.001.0001/acprof-9780199587230-chapter-14);
an article on [the text and form of the *Lay Folks' Catechism*](https://academic.oup.com/res/article-abstract/70/293/14/5232559); 
and [a review article](https://www.brepolsonline.net/doi/10.1484/J.YLS.5.116161) on John Burrow and Thorlac Turvile-Petre's edition of the archetype of *Piers Plowman* B.
Details on these and other publications can be found on [zotero](https://www.zotero.org/irc7) and elsewhere. 

At Loyola I teach an introduction to literary reading and a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey (antiquity and Middle Ages), upper-division and graduate courses in medieval English and European literature, and an introduction to Old English language and literature. 
In Spring 2019 I taught a ten-week graduate seminar at the Newberry Library on [Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy* and its afterlife](https://icornelius.github.io/boethius2019/).

With James Eric Ensley I am producing a documentary edition of New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23 for the [*Piers Plowman* Electronic Archive](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/).
Other work in progress includes 
a study of the text and sources of John Walton's 1410 verse translation of Boethius's *Consolatio philosophiae* 
and essays on 
1. the language and meter of some Middle English lyrics (for a volume on Middle English lyric poetry); 
2. the sources of George Colvile's 1556 translation of Boethius's *Consolatio* (for a volume on literary scholasticism);
3. 'ecologies of Latin poetics' (for a volume on post-classical Latin literatures);
4. extra-diegetic address in *Piers Plowman*;
and 
5. the prosody of mixed-language lines in the same poem.
