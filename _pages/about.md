I teach in the [Department of English at Loyola University Chicago](http://www.luc.edu/english/index.shtml) as [Edward Surtz, S.J.](https://www.luc.edu/english/surtz.shtml), Associate Professor. 
My research is concentrated on medieval English poetry, especially Middle English alliterative verse. 
I also study aspects of literary education and Latin literary culture in medieval England. 
I am author of [*Reconstructing Alliterative Verse: The Pursuit of a Medieval Meter*](http://www.cambridge.org/9781107154100), available from Cambridge University Press. 

Current projects include 
an essay on Middle English lyric; 
essays on extra-diegetic address in *Piers Plowman*
and on the prosody of mixed-language lines in the same poem; 
an edition (with James Eric Ensley) of Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23 for the [*Piers Plowman *Electronic Archive](http://piers.chass.ncsu.edu/); 
and studies of the texts and sources of two late medieval/early mod. English translations of Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy*: 
John Walton's versification (c. 1410), 
and George Colvile's 1556 prose rendering.

At Loyola I teach an introduction to literary reading and a first-year interdisciplinary humanities survey (antiquity and Middle Ages), plus upper-division and graduate courses in medieval English and European literature, and an introduction to Old English language and literature. 
In Spring 2019 I taught a ten-week graduate seminar at the Newberry Library on [Boethius's *Consolation of Philosophy* and its afterlife](https://icornelius.github.io/boethius2019/).
