## research area

I study medieval English literature, especially the text, form, and language of Middle English poetry, 
and aspects of literary education and Latin literary culture in the Middle Ages. 
With James Eric Ensley I am producing a documentary edition of New Haven, Beinecke Library, Takamiya MS 23 for the *Piers Plowman* Electronic Archive. 
Other work in progress includes 
a study of the text and sources of John Walton's 1410 verse translation of Boethius's *Consolatio philosophiae* 
and essays on 
1. the language and meter of some Middle English lyrics (for a volume on Middle English lyric poetry); 
2. the sources of George Colvile's 1556 translation of Boethius's *Consolatio* (for a volume on literary scholasticism);
3. 'ecologies of Latin poetics' (for a volume on post-classical Latin literatures);
4. extra-diegetic address in *Piers Plowman*;
and 
5. the prosody of mixed-language lines in the same poem.
